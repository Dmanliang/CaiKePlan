ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt
* project.properties.bak

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\commons-lang-2.4-javadoc.jar => app\libs\commons-lang-2.4-javadoc.jar
* libs\commons-lang-2.4-sources.jar => app\libs\commons-lang-2.4-sources.jar
* libs\commons-lang-2.4.jar => app\libs\commons-lang-2.4.jar
* libs\httpclient-4.2.5.jar => app\libs\httpclient-4.2.5.jar
* libs\httpclient-cache-4.2.5.jar => app\libs\httpclient-cache-4.2.5.jar
* libs\httpcore-4.2.4.jar => app\libs\httpcore-4.2.4.jar
* libs\httpmime-4.2.5.jar => app\libs\httpmime-4.2.5.jar
* libs\SocialSDK_QQ_Simplify.jar => app\libs\SocialSDK_QQ_Simplify.jar
* libs\SocialSDK_Sina_Simplify.jar => app\libs\SocialSDK_Sina_Simplify.jar
* libs\SocialSDK_WeChat_Simplify.jar => app\libs\SocialSDK_WeChat_Simplify.jar
* libs\umeng_shareboard_widget.jar => app\libs\umeng_shareboard_widget.jar
* libs\umeng_social_api.jar => app\libs\umeng_social_api.jar
* libs\umeng_social_net.jar => app\libs\umeng_social_net.jar
* libs\umeng_social_shareboard.jar => app\libs\umeng_social_shareboard.jar
* libs\umeng_social_shareview.jar => app\libs\umeng_social_shareview.jar
* libs\umeng_social_tool.jar => app\libs\umeng_social_tool.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
